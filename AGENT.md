## Core principles

- When you see changes made outside your knowledge, use the current version as your new starting point. Do not blindly overwrite those changes or you sucks.

## Build instructions

- When you need to use `go build` to test builds, make sure the binary is located under `.bin` to be ignored by `.gitignore`.
